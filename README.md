# Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing-Course-PJ
Course PJ of COMP130192 Parallel and Distributed Computing 

Choose two out of the following three projects to complete. I choose the first two, since i don't find suitable test data and i am too lazy to generate test data by myself.ðŸ˜œ

## PJ-1 OpenMP Implementation of Parallel QuickSort Algorithm
We use C++ for OpenMP programming in this experiment. 

For details of the implementation, experimental methods, and results, please refer to [pj1.md](PJ1-OpenMP-qsort/pj1.md)

## PJ-2 Parallel Sorting by Regular Sampling Algorithm in a Non-Shared Memory Multi-Machine Environment
We use C++ and MPI to implement the parallel sorting by regular sampling algorithm in this experiment.

For details of the implementation, experimental methods, and results, please refer to [pj2.md](PJ2-MPI-PSRS/pj2.md)


## PJ-3 Using MapReduce Programming Model to Implement the WordCount Algorithm by Hadoop framework 
Installing Hadoop is a bit of a hassle, you can use the pre-installed Ubuntu image. You can find it [here](https://dblab.xmu.edu.cn/blog/1645/).

Due to the lack of suitable test data, I didn't choose this PJ.

## Other PJ
You can do some extra PJ and give a presentation about your PJ to get some extra scores, like implementating Large-Scale Language Model Computation using MapReduce Framework, Parallel Matrix Multiplication Implementation with MPI and CUDA Heterogeneous Computing, ...


## Some Problem in Final Exam
What are the components of the distributed file system GFS?

Using MapReduce to implement Page Rank
